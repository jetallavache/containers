# stl-containers-lib

## Introduction

My own library that implements the basic standard C++ associative container classes: `set`, `map` and `multiset`. 

This implementation provides a complete set of standard methods and attributes for processing elements, checking container capacity, and iterating.

## Build/Installation

Simple build procedure:

```shell
$ make
